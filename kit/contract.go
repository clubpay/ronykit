// RouteSelector holds information about how this Contract is going to be selected. Each
// Gateway may need different information to route the request to the right Contract.
// RouteSelector is actually a base interface and Gateway implementors usually implement
// either RESTRouteSelector, RPCRouteSelector or both. It is an interface that provides methods
// for querying and getting the encoding of a routing object. Implementations of RouteSelector are
// used by Gateway to handle different types of request routing based on the method and protocol. The
// Query method is for searching specific routes with a query string, and GetEncoding is for
// returning the encoding format required for communication between the gateway and the target contract.
type RouteSelector interface {
	Query(q string) any
	GetEncoding() Encoding

// RESTRouteSelector is an interface that extends RouteSelector with methods specific to REST operations,
// primarily used by REST-based gateways. With GetMethod and GetPath methods, this interface provides
// the HTTP method and path information necessary for routing REST requests to the appropriate contract.
// Implementations of this interface are expected to provide their own GetMethod and GetPath methods that
// return the desired method and path as strings.

// RPCRouteSelector defines the RouteSelector which could be used in RPC operations.
// Gateway implementation which handle RPC requests could check the selector if it supports RPC.
// It is an interface that extends RouteSelector with a method specific to RPC operations. It is primarily
// used by RPC-based gateways for routing RPC requests to the appropriate contract. Implementations of this
// interface should provide their own GetPredicate method, which returns a string representing a predicate
// used to evaluate the route. In this context, a predicate is a condition or criteria that helps in
// selecting the proper handler for the RPC request.

// EdgeSelectorFunc returns the target EdgeServer's ID in the Cluster. If you have
// multiple instances of the EdgeServer, and you want to forward some requests to a specific
// instance, you can set up this function in desc.Contract's SetCoordinator method, then, the
// receiving EdgeServer will detect the target instance by calling this function and forwards
// the request to the returned instance.
// From the external client point of view this forwarding request is not observable.

// Contract defines the set of Handlers based on the Query. Query is different per bundles,
// hence, this is the implementor's task to make sure return correct value based on 'q'.

// order to be usable by Gateway 'gw' otherwise it panics.
