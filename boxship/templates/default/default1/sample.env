# DOMAIN is the TLD which boxship will use in generating certificates and setting up Traefik
# For example, if you set httpRoute.subdomain = 'core' and DOMAIN is set to 'nested'
# boxship generates the certificates and traefik routes to make the container accessible from
# core.nested.boxship.dev.
# Please note that you have to update your /etc/hosts for any subdomain that you define.
# like: 127.0.0.1  core.nested.boxship.dev
DOMAIN=yourdomain


# CA_CERT_FILE & CA_KEY_FILE are the root certifacte authority of boxship. You can create
# your own pair by calling `boxship gen-root-ca --out ./setup/rootca/'. But this is optional
# because we already created it for you and they exists in the ./setup/rootca folder.
# Also since we are going to use our own ca certificate then we need to install ./ca.cer file
# in on our operating system. You can find instructions for each OS from the following links:
# MacOS: https://www.bounca.org/tutorials/install_root_certificate.html
# Windows: https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/visual-cobol/VC40/CSWin/HHSTSTCERT03.html
# Or if you just want to install it on your browser:
