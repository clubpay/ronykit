# Release It! Framework

Framework for designing, deploying, and operating production-ready software.
The software that passes QA is not the software that survives production —
production is hostile, and systems must expect and handle failure at every
level.

## When to use

- Hardening a RonyKit service before launch or after an outage.
- Reviewing inter-service stub calls, DB queries, or third-party integrations.
- Designing retries, rate limits, or graceful degradation.

## RonyKit hooks

Before rolling your own resilience primitives, check workspace packages and MCP
resources:

| Concern | Reach for |
| ------- | --------- |
| Rate limiting | `x/ratelimit` |
| Structured logging / traces | `x/telemetry/logkit`, `x/telemetry/tracekit` |
| Durable workflows (retries, sagas) | `flow` module — never import Temporal SDK directly |
| Settings / feature flags | `x/settings` |
| Batch / backpressure | `x/batch` |

Read MCP `characteristics/telemetry` and `architecture/inter-service-stubs`
when adding outbound calls. Every stub and HTTP client needs timeouts; propagate
`context.Context` deadlines from handlers through `app` to repo and outbound
calls.

## Core Principle

**Every system will eventually be pushed beyond its design limits.** The question is not whether failures happen, but whether your system degrades gracefully or collapses catastrophically. Production-ready software is not just correct — it is resilient, observable, and operates through partial failures without human intervention.

## Scoring

**Goal: 8/8.** Score a production system by the Quick Diagnostic: **1 point per row answered "yes"** across the 8 checks (timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads, zero-downtime deploy, deep health checks, correlated telemetry, load-tested past peak, failure injection). Bands: **7-8** = every integration point is bounded, isolated, observable, and deploy/release are decoupled; **4-5** = some patterns present but ≥3 diagnostic rows fail (e.g. unbounded retries, shared pools, shallow health checks); **≤2** = relies on the happy path with no breakers, no capacity model, no failure testing. Always state the current score, the failing rows, and the specific fix for each.

## The Release It! Framework

Six areas that determine whether software survives contact with production:

### 1. Stability Anti-Patterns

**Core concept:** Failures propagate through integration points and cascade across system boundaries. The most dangerous patterns are not bugs in your code — they are emergent behaviors when systems interact under stress.

**Why it works:** These patterns recur across outages, so audit by name: walk every integration point and ask which anti-pattern it currently enables, then close that specific crack rather than hardening at random.

**Key insights:**
- Integration points are the number-one killer — every socket, HTTP call, or queue is a risk
- Slow responses are worse than no response: they tie up threads, exhaust pools, and propagate delay up the call chain
- Unbounded result sets turn a harmless query into an out-of-memory crash once data outgrows test assumptions
- Users generate load no test predicts — bots, retry storms, flash crowds; self-denial attacks happen when your own marketing overwhelms your infrastructure
- Blocked threads are the silent killer — deadlocks and contention show no errors until everything stops

**Code applications:**

| Context | Guard | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| HTTP calls | Assume every remote call can fail, hang, or return garbage | Wrap all external calls with timeout + circuit breaker |
| Database queries | Enforce result set limits | Add `LIMIT`; paginate all list endpoints |
| Thread pools | Isolate pools per dependency | Separate pool for payment gateway vs. search |
| Marketing events | Coordinate launches with capacity planning | Pre-scale before Black Friday; queue coupon redemptions |

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) when triaging an outage or hardening an integration point — each anti-pattern with its failure scenario and the symptom that detects it.

### 2. Stability Patterns

**Core concept:** Counter each anti-pattern with a stability pattern: circuit breakers stop cascades, bulkheads isolate blast radius, timeouts reclaim stuck resources. Together they make a system bend under load instead of breaking.

**Why it works:** Each pattern caps the damage one failure can do: a breaker trip converts an unbounded cascade into a fast local rejection, a bulkhead confines the outage to one pool. Treat a tripped breaker as expected output, not an incident — page on the breaker *staying* open, not on it opening.

**Key insights:**
- Circuit Breaker: three states (closed, open, half-open) — trips after threshold failures, periodically tests recovery
- Timeouts: every outbound call needs connect AND read timeouts, propagated up the call chain
- Retry with exponential backoff + jitter prevents thundering herd on recovery
- Fail Fast: reject requests you know will fail instead of wasting resources; Handshaking lets the server decline work before it's sent
- Steady State: systems accumulate cruft (logs, sessions, temp files) — design automatic cleanup
- Let It Crash: a clean restart often beats limping along in an unknown state

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Service calls | Circuit Breaker | Open after 5 failures in 60s; half-open after 30s |
| Resource isolation | Bulkhead | Dedicated connection pools for critical vs. non-critical |
| Network calls | Timeout with propagation | Connect 1s, read 5s; propagate deadline downstream |
| Retries | Backoff + jitter + budget | Base 100ms, max 3 retries, 20% fleet retry budget |
| Data cleanup | Steady State | Purge sessions >24h; rotate logs at 500MB |

See [references/stability-patterns.md](references/stability-patterns.md) when implementing a breaker or tuning thresholds — state-machine diagram, parameter ranges, what-counts-as-failure tables, and how to combine patterns.

### 3. Capacity and Availability

**Core concept:** Capacity is not one number — it is a multi-dimensional function of CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, connection pools, and threads. Capacity planning means knowing which resource bottlenecks first, and at what load.

**Why it works:** Untested systems fail at peak load — the worst possible moment. Knowing actual (not theoretical) limits lets you set realistic SLAs and scale before users hit the wall.

**Key insights:**
- Test taxonomy: load test (expected traffic), stress test (beyond limits), soak test (sustained, catches leaks), spike test (sudden bursts)
- Universal Scalability Law: throughput never scales linearly — contention and coherence costs cause diminishing returns
- Pool exhaustion looks identical to a database outage from the application's perspective; size pools from measured concurrency, not defaults
- "The cloud is infinitely scalable" is a myth — auto-scaling has lag, cold starts, and hard limits

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Load testing | Ramp to peak, then 2x, observe degradation | Increase RPS until latency exceeds SLO |
| Connection pools | Size from measured concurrency | Set pool to P99 active connections + 20% headroom |
| Soak testing | 80% capacity for 24-72 hours | Catch memory/connection/file-handle leaks |
| Capacity model | Document bottleneck per service | "Service X is memory-bound at 2000 RPS; 4GB per instance" |

See [references/capacity-planning.md](references/capacity-planning.md) when planning a load test or sizing pools — test methodologies, pool/thread tuning, and Universal Scalability Law modeling.

### 4. Deployment and Release

**Core concept:** Deployment (putting code on servers) and release (exposing it to users) are separate operations that should be decoupled — deploy without risk, release with confidence.

**Why it works:** Most outages are caused by changes. Decoupling lets you deploy to production, verify, and only then route traffic; if something breaks, you roll back the release, not the deployment.

**Key insights:**
- Zero-downtime deployment is non-negotiable: rolling, blue-green, or canary
- Feature flags dark-launch code and enable it independently of deployment
- Database migrations must be backward-compatible — old and new code run simultaneously during deploys (expand-contract)
- Immutable infrastructure: never patch a running server — build a new image, deploy, destroy the old
- Rollback must be faster than roll-forward; if rollback takes 30 minutes, you will avoid deploying

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Deploys | Blue-green with health check gate | Deploy to green; smoke test; swap router |
| Progressive rollout | Canary with automated rollback | 5% traffic to canary; auto-rollback if error rate >1% |
| Feature launch | Flags with emergency off switch | Ship behind flag; enable for 10%; monitor; ramp |
| Schema changes | Expand-contract migration | Add column; write both; backfill; drop old |

See [references/deployment-strategies.md](references/deployment-strategies.md) when planning a release or a schema change — blue-green/canary/rolling mechanics, expand-contract migration steps, and infrastructure-as-code.

### 5. Health Checks and Observability

**Core concept:** You cannot operate what you cannot observe. Health checks, metrics, logs, and traces are the sensory organs of your system in production — a first-class design concern, not an afterthought.

**Why it works:** Untraced failures are invisible until a user reports them. Emit high-cardinality, structured events (not just pre-aggregated counters) so you can ask new questions of past incidents without shipping new instrumentation first.

**Key insights:**
- Health checks come in two flavors: shallow (process alive) and deep (dependencies reachable, resources available)
- Three pillars: structured logs (what happened), metrics (how much), distributed traces (where and how long)
- RED method for services: Rate, Errors, Duration; USE method for resources: Utilization, Saturation, Errors
- Define SLIs (measure user experience) → SLOs (targets) → SLAs (contracts), in that order
- Alert on symptoms users feel (error rate, latency), not causes (CPU); dashboards should answer "is the system healthy?" within 5 seconds

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Health endpoints | Deep health check | `/health` reports DB, cache, queue, disk status |
| Service metrics | RED instrumentation | Rate, error rate, p50/p95/p99 latency per endpoint |
| Distributed tracing | Propagate trace context | Trace ID in headers; correlate logs across services |
| Alerting | SLO burn rate, not raw thresholds | "Error budget burning 10x" vs. "CPU > 80%" |

See [references/observability.md](references/observability.md) when instrumenting a service or setting SLOs — health-check design, RED/USE metric sets, the SLI→SLO→SLA chain, and burn-rate alerting.

### 6. Adaptation and Chaos Engineering

> **Safety note:** Chaos engineering experiments are design-time planning activities. The patterns below describe *what to test* and *what to verify*, not actions for an AI agent to execute autonomously. All failure injection must be performed by authorized engineers using dedicated tooling (e.g., Gremlin, Litmus, AWS FIS) with proper approvals, rollback plans, and blast radius controls in place.

**Core concept:** Confidence in resilience comes from testing under realistic failure conditions. Chaos engineering experiments on a system in a controlled way to build confidence it withstands turbulence.

**Why it works:** You cannot know how a system handles failure until it actually fails; controlled injection turns unknown-unknowns into known-knowns before they cause real outages.

**Key insights:**
- Define steady state first — you need a measurable baseline to detect deviation
- Every experiment has a hypothesis: "We believe that when X fails, the system will Y"
- Start small in non-production (kill one process, add latency to one call), then escalate gradually with approvals
- Minimize blast radius: canary populations, feature flags, emergency stop; production experiments require explicit authorization and instant rollback
- Automate recurring experiments; GameDay exercises test both the system and the team
- Build a culture where finding weaknesses is celebrated, not punished

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Process failure | Controlled termination via chaos tooling | Kill one pod with Gremlin/Litmus; verify recovery within SLO |
| Network failure | Inject latency/partition via chaos tooling | +500ms on DB calls; verify circuit breaker trips |
| Dependency failure | Simulate downstream outage via chaos tooling | Return 503 from payment API; verify graceful degradation |
| GameDay | Scheduled team exercise | "Primary DB goes read-only at 2pm" — practice response |

See [references/chaos-engineering.md](references/chaos-engineering.md) when designing a failure experiment or GameDay — steady-state hypothesis, blast-radius controls, and how to grow the practice from non-prod outward.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **No timeouts on outbound calls** | One slow dependency freezes the system | Connect and read timeouts on every external call |
| **Unbounded retries** | Retry storms amplify failures | Exponential backoff, jitter, fleet-wide retry budgets |
| **Shared thread/connection pools** | One failing dependency drains everything | Bulkhead: isolate pools per dependency |
| **Shallow health checks only** | Traffic routed to instances with broken dependencies | Deep health checks that verify downstream connectivity |
| **Testing only the happy path** | Works perfectly until the first real failure | Load, soak, and chaos test before major releases |
| **Coupling deploy and release** | Every deployment is all-or-nothing high risk | Feature flags, canary, blue-green |
| **Alerting on causes, not symptoms** | CPU alerts fire while users suffer silently | Alert on user-facing SLIs: errors, latency, availability |
| **No capacity model** | System falls over at 2x load | Model bottlenecks; load test to 3x expected peak |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any production system:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does every outbound call have a timeout? | Calls hang, blocking threads | Add connect and read timeouts everywhere |
| Are circuit breakers on critical dependencies? | One failure takes down the system | Add breakers with tuned thresholds |
| Are pools isolated per dependency? | Failures cross-contaminate | Implement bulkheads with dedicated pools |
| Can you deploy without downtime? | Deployments cause outages | Rolling, blue-green, or canary deployment |
| Do health checks verify dependencies? | Dead instances receive traffic | Deep health checks testing DB, cache, queue |
| Are logs, metrics, and traces correlated? | Debugging means manual log searches | Distributed tracing with correlated IDs |
| Have you load-tested beyond expected peak? | Unknown failure mode under real load | Test to 2-3x peak; document the breaking point |
| Do you practice failure injection? | Resilience is theoretical | Start chaos engineering with low-risk experiments |
