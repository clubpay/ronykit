# A Philosophy of Software Design Framework

A practical framework for managing the fundamental challenge of software engineering: complexity. Apply these principles when designing modules, reviewing APIs, refactoring code, or advising on architecture decisions.

## When to use

- Designing the method set of `internal/app.App`, a `repo` port, or a shared
  package before writing it.
- Reviewing a PR that adds an interface, wrapper, option struct, or new layer.
- A change keeps touching the handler, app, repo, and SQL in lockstep.
- Deciding what a Go doc comment on an exported identifier should say.

## RonyKit applications

RonyKit's layers are fixed (see `go-design`); this skill judges whether
each layer is **deep** within those fixed boundaries.

| Red flag in a feature module | Why it is shallow or leaky | Fix |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| App method that forwards to a repo call while the rule it should own sits in the handler or SQL | Pass-through: the layer exists but hides nothing | Move the rule into the app method (or the domain type). A thin app method for plain CRUD is fine — handlers must still go through `internal/app`. |
| Port method per SQL query (`GetByA`, `GetByB`, `GetByAAndB`…) | Special-purpose interface; storage shape leaks inward | Fewer, domain-level methods (`ListInvoices(ctx, filter)`); keep query variety inside `repo/v0`. |
| sqlc row types or `rony` context passed into `internal/app` | Information leakage across the boundary | Map to domain types at the repo/handler edge. |
| Interface with exactly one implementation and no test fake | Indirection without depth | Keep the concrete type; add the interface when a second implementation (or the port boundary) needs it. Repo ports are the exception — they are the boundary. |
| Option structs / flags for "just this one case" | Configuration pushed onto callers | Decide the default inside the module; expose only what callers truly vary. |
| Doc comment repeats the signature | Comment adds nothing | Say what the abstraction promises: units, invariants, error cases, side effects. |

Pair with `go-modern` for idiom and `code-review` when this is a review.

## Core Principle

**The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating.** Complexity is the enemy: it makes systems hard to understand, hard to modify, and a source of bugs. Evaluate every design decision by asking "Does this increase or decrease the overall complexity of the system?" — the goal is not zero complexity, but minimizing unnecessary complexity and concentrating the necessary kind where it can be managed.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating a design, score it by counting how many of the eight Quick Diagnostic rows it satisfies (≈1.25 points each), then sanity-check against the bands:

- **9-10** — deep modules with interfaces far simpler than implementations; no information leakage (an implementation can change without touching callers); interface comments capture design intent; design improvement is routine. All eight diagnostics pass.
- **6-8** — mostly deep, but one or two leaks, shallow types, or undocumented abstractions. 5-6 diagnostics pass.
- **3-5** — classitis or temporal decomposition, recurring leakage, comments that only restate code. 2-4 diagnostics pass.
- **≤2** — tactical-tornado code: shallow modules, pervasive leakage, no design intent recorded. 0-1 diagnostics pass.

Always state the current score, the diagnostic rows that failed, and the specific change each one needs to reach 10/10.

## The Software Design Framework

Six principles for managing complexity and producing systems that are easy to understand and modify:

### 1. Complexity and Its Causes

**Core concept:** Complexity is anything about a system's structure that makes it hard to understand and modify. It shows three symptoms — change amplification, cognitive load, and unknown unknowns — and has two causes: dependencies and obscurity.

**Key insights:**
- Change amplification: a simple change requires edits in many places
- Cognitive load: a developer must hold too much in mind to make a change
- Unknown unknowns: it isn't obvious what must change or what information is relevant — the worst symptom
- Complexity is incremental — it accumulates from hundreds of small decisions ("death by a thousand cuts"), so every decision matters

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Change amplification | Centralize shared knowledge | Extract color constants instead of hardcoding `#ff0000` in 20 files |
| Cognitive load | Reduce what developers must know | `os.Open(path)` instead of requiring buffer size, encoding, lock mode |
| Unknown unknowns | Make dependencies explicit | Type systems and interfaces surface what a change affects |
| Obscurity | Name things precisely | `numBytesReceived` not `n`; `retryDelayMs` not `delay` |

See [references/complexity-symptoms.md](references/complexity-symptoms.md) when you need to name *which* symptom a codebase has before fixing it — per-symptom recognition tests, the dependency taxonomy (syntactic/semantic/temporal/hidden), the C = Σ(cp·tp) cost formula, and a 10-row red-flag table.

### 2. Deep vs Shallow Modules

**Core concept:** The best modules are deep: powerful functionality behind a simple interface. Shallow modules have complex interfaces relative to the functionality they provide — they add complexity rather than hiding it.

**Why it works:** The interface is the *cost* a module imposes on the rest of the system; the implementation is the benefit. So a method that is harder to learn than to re-implement yourself is net-negative — depth, not line count, decides whether a module earns its place.

**Key insights:**
- Depth = functionality provided / interface complexity imposed (Unix file I/O and Go's `io.Reader` are deep; Java's stacked stream wrappers are the classic shallow counterexample)
- "Classitis": the disease of creating too many small, shallow types — in Go it shows up as tiny packages, one-method interfaces with a single implementation, and pass-through layers; each boundary adds cognitive load
- Small methods are not inherently good; depth matters more than size
- The best abstractions hide significant complexity behind a few simple concepts

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Deep module | Hide complexity behind simple API | `os.ReadFile(path)` hides descriptors, buffering, and short reads; `database/sql` hides connection pooling |
| Classitis cure | Merge related shallow types | `orderParser` + `orderValidator` + `orderProcessor` → one `App.PlaceOrder` plus a validating `domain.NewOrder` |
| Interface simplicity | Fewer parameters, fewer methods | A typed `x/settings` struct with defaults, not 15 constructor parameters |

See [references/deep-modules.md](references/deep-modules.md) when judging whether an abstraction pulls its weight — before/after code for the depth ratio, the classitis cure worked out, and case studies (Unix I/O, GC, TCP/IP).

### 3. Information Hiding and Leakage

**Core concept:** Each module should encapsulate knowledge not needed by other modules. Information leakage — one design decision reflected in multiple modules — is one of the most important red flags in software design.

**Why it works:** A decision that lives in one module can change there and nowhere else; the same decision leaked into N modules turns one edit into N edits that no compiler will remind you to make. Hiding is what converts change amplification back into a local change.

**Key insights:**
- Temporal decomposition causes leakage: splitting code by *when* things happen forces shared knowledge across phases — organize by knowledge instead
- Back-door leakage through data formats, protocols, or shared assumptions is the subtlest form
- Decorators frequently leak — they expose the decorated interface
- If two modules share knowledge, merge them or create a new module that encapsulates it

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Format leakage | Centralize serialization | The wire format lives only in `api/` DTOs (`json` tags); domain types never carry tags or call `rkit.ToJSON` |
| Temporal decomposition | Organize by knowledge, not time | Combine "read config" and "apply config" into one typed `x/settings` struct |
| Protocol leakage | Abstract transport details | `notifier.Notify(ctx, msg)` hides whether delivery is HTTP, a stub call, or a queue |

See [references/information-hiding.md](references/information-hiding.md) when a change forces you to edit two modules in lockstep — the four leakage forms with code (interface, back-door, temporal, decorator), five reduction strategies, the HTTP-handling case study, and a detection table.

### 4. General-Purpose vs Special-Purpose Modules

**Core concept:** Design modules that are "somewhat general-purpose": an interface general enough to support multiple uses, with an implementation that handles current needs. Ask: "What is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs?"

**Why it works:** Counterintuitively, the general interface is usually the *simpler* one — special-case methods multiply as requirements grow, while one general method absorbs them. The trap is the other direction: generality the current needs don't demand is speculative complexity, paid now for a use case that may never arrive.

**Key insights:**
- "Somewhat general-purpose" is the sweet spot between too specific and too generic
- Push complexity downward: lower-level modules should handle hard cases so upper levels stay simple
- Configuration parameters often represent a failure to decide — each parameter is complexity pushed onto the caller
- When in doubt, implement the simpler, more general-purpose approach first

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| API generality | Design for the concept, not one use case | `doc.Insert(pos, text)` instead of `doc.AddBulletPoint()` |
| Reduce configuration | Determine behavior automatically | Auto-detect file encoding instead of an `encoding` parameter |
| Avoid over-specialization | One general method over many specific ones | `Notify(ctx, recipient, msg Message)` instead of `SendWelcomeEmail`, `SendResetEmail`, `SendReceiptEmail` (repository ports are the exception: they stay in domain language — see `domain-driven-design`) |

See [references/general-vs-special.md](references/general-vs-special.md) when choosing how general an interface should be — the "simplest interface for all current needs" test, the configuration-parameter antipattern, and push-complexity-downward worked through.

### 5. Comments as Design Documentation

**Core concept:** Comments should describe what is not obvious from the code: design intent, abstraction rationale, invariants, and assumptions. "Good code is self-documenting" is a myth for anything beyond low-level implementation detail.

**Why it works:** Code can only ever record *what* it does — never why this approach over the alternatives, or what it silently assumes. That rationale is the most perishable information in a system: it lives only in the author's head and is gone the moment they move on, so a comment is the single chance to capture it.

**Key insights:**
- Four types: interface comments (most important — they define the abstraction), data structure member comments, implementation comments, cross-module comments
- Write comments first (comment-driven design) to clarify thinking before code
- Don't repeat what the code makes clear; keep comments next to the code they describe and update them together
- If a comment is hard to write, the design may be too complex

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Interface comment | Describe the abstraction, not the implementation | "// ClosestWidget returns the widget nearest pos, and false if none is within threshold." |
| Data structure comment | Explain invariants | "// jobs is sorted by priority descending; ties keep insertion order." |
| Implementation comment | Explain why, not what | "// Binary search: jobs is always sorted and can hold 100k+ items." |
| Cross-module comment | Link related decisions | "// Must stay below the gateway's 30s idle timeout (see settings.GatewayTimeout)." |

See [references/comments-as-design.md](references/comments-as-design.md) when writing or reviewing comments and unsure what belongs in one — the four comment types with examples, the comment-driven-design procedure, and the rebuttal to the self-documenting-code myth.

### 6. Strategic vs Tactical Programming

**Core concept:** Tactical programming gets features working quickly and accumulates complexity with each shortcut. Strategic programming invests 10-20% extra effort in good design, treating every change as an opportunity to improve structure.

**Why it works:** Tactical speed is borrowed: each shortcut makes future changes harder, while the strategic investment compounds — strategically designed systems are faster to work with within months.

**Key insights:**
- Tactical tornado: a developer who ships fast but leaves wreckage — celebrated short-term, destructive long-term
- Your primary job is a great design that happens to work, not working code that happens to have a design
- Startups need strategic programming most — early shortcuts compound into crippling debt as the team grows
- Every change is an investment opportunity: leave the code a little better; refactoring is part of every feature, not a special event

**Code applications:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tactical trap | Resist quick-and-dirty fixes | Don't add a boolean parameter for "just this one special case" |
| Strategic investment | Improve structure during feature work | Refactor an awkward module interface while adding the feature |
| Design reviews | Evaluate structure, not just correctness | Ask "does this make the system simpler?" not just "does it work?" |

See [references/strategic-programming.md](references/strategic-programming.md) when deciding how much design effort a change deserves, or making the case for it — the 10-20% investment math, the tactical-tornado pattern, and why startups need strategic programming most.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Creating too many small types, packages, or interfaces** | Classitis adds interfaces without depth; each boundary is cognitive overhead | Merge related shallow pieces into deeper modules |
| **Splitting modules by temporal order** | "Read, then process, then write" forces shared knowledge across modules | Group code that shares knowledge into one module |
| **Exposing implementation in interfaces** | Callers depend on internals; changes propagate | Design interfaces around abstractions; hide formats and protocols |
| **Treating comments as optional** | Design intent and assumptions are lost; newcomers guess wrong | Write interface comments first; maintain with the code |
| **Configuration parameters for everything** | A parameter offloaded to the caller is a decision you declined to make (see §4) | Determine behavior automatically; provide sensible defaults |
| **Quick-and-dirty tactical fixes** | Shortcuts compound until the system is unworkable | Invest 10-20% extra; treat every change as a design opportunity |
| **Pass-through methods** | A method that only forwards its arguments to another adds an interface but no functionality | Merge the pass-through into the caller or the callee |
| **Designing for specific use cases** | Special-purpose interfaces accumulate special cases | Ask: simplest interface covering all current needs? |

## Quick Diagnostic

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Can you describe each module in one sentence? | Modules do too much or lack purpose | Split into coherent, describable responsibilities |
| Are interfaces simpler than implementations? | Modules are shallow — complexity leaks outward | Hide more; merge shallow types into deeper ones |
| Can you change an implementation without affecting callers? | Information is leaking across boundaries | Encapsulate the leaked knowledge in one module |
| Do interface comments describe the abstraction? | Design intent lost; module will be misused | Document what the module promises, not how it works |
| Is design discussion part of code reviews? | Reviews catch bugs but not complexity growth | Add "does this reduce complexity?" to review criteria |
| Does each module hide an important design decision? | Modules organized around code, not information | Reorganize so each module owns specific knowledge |
| Can a newcomer understand module boundaries without reading implementations? | Abstractions undocumented or leaky | Improve interface comments; simplify interfaces |
| Are you spending 10-20% of time on design improvement? | Debt accumulates with every feature | Include design improvement in every PR |
