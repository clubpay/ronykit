# RonyKIT
RonyKIT is a set of tools that are designed to be extendable and flexible to write a complete API/Edge server quickly.
When you develop API handlers using RonyKIT framework, you can support RPC and REST style APIs without re-writing the
endpoint layer multiple times.

If you are looking for a framework to write your API/Edge server, you can use `rony` package directly, which provides
an easy-to-use framework and with help of Go Generics, it provides a very clean and easy to use API. This is the
recommended way to use RonyKIT framework. However, if you want to have more control over your API server, and are
very concern about performance and memory usage, you can use `kit` package directly, which is the heart of the RonyKIT
framework.
