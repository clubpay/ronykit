# RonyKit 
RonyKit provides the abstraction layer for creating a cluster aware API server. By defining separate 
components for each task, you are almost free to develop your API server using RPC (Proto/JSON/...),
REST, GraphQL or even with your in-house defined protocol. However, some components are implemented
in the 'std' which make it easy to use RonyKit out of the box.

RonyKIT is a successor of [Rony](https://github.com/ronaksoft/rony), with lessons from using it in multiple productions.
In RonyKIT, I wanted to make it more flexible but still very performant. I will maintain two bundles for REST and RPC, 
however you are not limited to use those, and can build your own Bundles. To have a better understanding of how it is 
going to work please check examples folder. in [simple-rest-server](examples/simple-rest-server) it shows a very simple 
hello world app. in [mixed-jsonrpc-rest](examples/mixed-jsonrpc-rest) it shows how you can write your services once but 
use them with multiple formats like REST or RPC. 

## Gateway
Gateway defines the interface that Edge server communicate with clients.

## Cluster [Coming Soon]
Cluster defines the interface that Edge server instances communicate with each other. 

# Benchmark 
## Simple Echo 
We used wrk to benchmark Ronykit standard REST implementation vs Fiber which is fully optimized for REST
