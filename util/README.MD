# Utils

This package contains a good few number of helper functions which are commonly used
in projects. We used some of them in RonyKIT internally and exposed them in this separate package
to let other projects use it easily.

Some utilities this package provides:

1. Random generators for String, Digits, ...
2. SpinLock: a mutex-free lock
3. Strings: transformation helper functions such as ToCamel, ToLowerCamel, ...
4. LinkedList
5. Hash: optimized version of Sha512 and Sha256 implementations of builtin hash functions.
